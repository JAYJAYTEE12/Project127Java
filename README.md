# Project127Java
A codebase port of Project 1.27 over to Java

---


This was made possibly for the GTA V Speedrunning community through almost a month of hard work by a number of dedicated individuals. This utility serves to not only allow downgrade of the existing GTA V patch, but subsequent patches as well down to the widely accepted speedrunning version of 1.27. This would not have been possible without the hard work of a number of very talented individuals from all walks of life who have contributed skills in Reverse Engineering, Programming, Decryption, Project Management, Scripting and Testing. Below is a list of some of the main contributors to the project although our thanks go out to everyone who has helped throughout the process. dr490n, Special For, thS, zCri, hossel, JakeMiester, MOMO, Daniel Kinau, Antibones, Aperture, Diamondo25

Special shoutouts to @dr490n who was responsible for getting the downgraded game to launch, added patches against in-game triggers, wrote the authentication backend, decryption and got the preorder entitlement to work.

Shoutout to FiveM and Goldberg, whose Source Code proved to be vital to understand and reverse engineer the GTA V Launch Process

Also shoutout to the [Open-Source GTAV Auto Patcher by DaWolf85](https://github.com/DaWolf85/GTAVAutoPatcher) which was an important resource during the development of this Client.
